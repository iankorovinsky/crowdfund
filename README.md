# CrowdFund
## 🌟 **Demo & Submission**  
🎥 **Demo:** [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/S20tTL5M9Ig?si=nO4tCv7REsGhUWYl)

🚀 **Submitted to:** TartanHacks 2025

*Note: One fun little sidequest we went on throughout the hackathon is [submitting a patch](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-py/pull/804) to XRP Ledger's Python SDK because we were having issues with the existing implementation of parallelism. We tried our best to make sure this issue was fixed for future hackers! 🤞*

## 💡 **Inspiration**  
We set out to **redefine crypto trading** by blending **AI automation** with **decentralized finance**. Traditional trading tools often require constant monitoring, manual execution, and complex strategies—**we wanted to change that**. Our platform empowers users to build **AI-driven workflows** that **analyze, strategize, and execute trades automatically**.  

More than just automation, we also wanted to create **a developer-friendly ecosystem** where anyone can build AI agents, protect their IP with **Story Protocol**, and **earn royalties** as others use their creations.  

## ⚡ **What It Does**

🖌️ **Create Custom Workspace** – Create or join a custom workspace to build your agentic flows; multiplayer mode enabled!

🤖 **AI-Driven Workflows** – Select AI agents to fetch market data, analyze trends, and make trading decisions.  

🔗 **Connect Your Crypto Wallet** – Seamlessly integrate with your wallet for direct trade execution.  

💰 **Automated Trades** – AI agents can execute buy/sell orders straight from your wallet.

🛠️ **Developer Royalties** – Create AI agents, secure IP via **Story Protocol**, and earn royalties from agent usage.  

🎟 **Ripple Integration** – Users **earn tokens** when they run workflows & **profit from currency swaps**.

## 🛠️ **How We Built It**  
Our stack includes:  
- **AI & ML Algorithms** – For market analysis and trade optimization.  
- **Smart Contracts** – Enabling royalties & secure agent ownership.  
- **XRP** – For token rewards and cross-border currency swaps.  
- **Story Protocol** – Tokenizing IP and handling developer payments. 

## 🚧 **Challenges We Faced**  
- **Optimizing AI Trading Strategies** – Balancing speed, accuracy, and risk management.  
- **Seamless Wallet Integration** – Ensuring smooth transactions across multiple blockchains.  
- **Building a Royalty System** – Implementing **Story Protocol** to track and compensate AI agent developers.  

## 🏆 **Accomplishments & Impact**  
✅ **Automated trading workflows that actually work** 🎯  
✅ **A functioning AI-agent marketplace with royalty distribution** 💡  
✅ **Ripple-powered token economy for users & developers** 💰  

## 🔮 **What's Next?**  
🚀 **Expanding AI Models** – Enhancing strategy prediction and risk assessment.  
🌍 **Multi-Chain Support** – Integrating with more blockchain networks.  
📈 **Advanced Trading Features** – Adding options trading, staking, and risk management tools.  

👾 **Join the future of AI-driven crypto trading!** 🚀

# Sponsor Prizes (Explanation of Technical Implementation)

Attached below are some ways that we implemented the following sponsor prizes:

## Best Use of Story Protocol

- Tokenized AI Agents as IP assets on-chain when developers uploaded their code
- Paid developers royalties when their AI agents were used in workflows

## XRP Ledger Challenge

- Issued community tokens using xrpl-py
- Experimented with [ElizaOS personalities](https://x.com/Crowdfund_Agent) and created a Crowdfund Agent to move to a human-in-the-loop approach as a future step
- Submitted a PR to xrpl-py (look to top)
- Not fully working implementation of swaps via bridging on XRP's technology, but ultimately didn't have enough time so we decided to focus on submitting the PR

## Best Use of AI/Gen AI (MLH)

- Orchestrated agents for automated trading workflows
- Used Langchain + Langgraph
- Used DALLE-2 for image generation for on-chain IP assets

## Best Use of Cloudflare (MLH)

- Stored AI agents in the cloud
- Were storing photos in the cloud for part of the hackathon but settled on locally stored cute icons instead

## Best Domain Name by GoDaddy (MLH)

- www.thisismorefunthan.work
- Building this project was pretty fun 😉
